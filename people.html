Alex is interested in creating machine learning models that are able to fail gracefully. A fundamental part of this is analyzing what relationships a model is actually learning by testing it against pathological examples. He's also interested in non-conventional loss functions since he believes that current loss functions are used mainly for convenience and don't represent underlying concepts that a model should learn. He has experience working with several types of data including pharmacogenomics data (both drugs and cell lines), time series data (not health related), and imaging data. Alex enjoys cooking, creating workout programs, and the occasional game of Starcraft 2. </p>
