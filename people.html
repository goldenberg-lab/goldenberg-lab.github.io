He also received both his HBSc from Trinity College at U of T and his MSc from U of T. His past projects include pediatric cancer detection and facial pain detection in people with dementia. His research interests lie in using deep learning for healthcare and medicine - specifically in learning effectively with mislabeled, noisy, or difficult data. Abhishek is an Education Trainee Co-Lead at the Temerty Centre for AI Education & Research in Medicine and a Junior Fellow at Massey College. He is also interested in AI pedagogy, governance, and ethics. In his free time, he loves films, drives, racquet sports, jazz/soul/house/disco music, and exploring Toronto's food scene (ask him about his favourite restaurants!).<br>

He focuses on biomedical machine learning, particularly with multi-modality and ICU datasets, and creating conversational agents for clinical assistive tools. He earned his undergraduate degree from Union College and a master’s degree from the University of Waterloo. His research experience includes developing an ambient assistant that helps primary care physicians with evidence-based medicine , and a framework that recommends ICU lab tests to reduce unnecessary procedures while maintaining patient safety. He also created a method that uses unpaired multimodal learning to link biological datasets and built computational pathology systems in previous roles. His work emphasizes translating methods into practical clinical tools by focusing on interpretable objectives, rigorous evaluation, and practical guidance.<br>

He is broadly interested in the synergy between computational and biological problem-solving. His research focuses on AI and ML methods for solving problems in medical bio-physics, while he is symmetrically also excited by bio-inspired computation. Thus far, he has mostly worked on bio-signal processing (clinical time-series & transcriptomics) with deep learning. In the interim, he also took an excursion to work with LLMs trained on the world’s largest computer chip during his co-op internship at Cerebras Systems.<br>

                                        <p>Aditya is an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying data science and statistics. His research interests and background are primarily in mathematical statistics, techniques for correlated data, and sampling algorithms. Aditya's goal is to develop robust methods for doing inference, in the service of being able to make actionable decisions from data. He occasionally also dabbles in other fields and applications (e.g. computational linguistics). At the Goldenberg Lab, he is currently studying machine learning methods for lab tests ordering, particularly in the presence of distribution shifts. In his free time, you’ll find him reading a book or (more likely) annoying his friends.<br>
