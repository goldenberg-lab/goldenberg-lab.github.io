                                                <p>Dr Goldenberg is a Scientist in Genetics and Genome Biology program at the SickKids Research Institute, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, cross appointed in the Department of Statistics, faculty member at Vector and a fellow at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), Child and Brain Development group. Dr Goldenberg trained in machine learning and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University, with a post-doctoral focus in computational biology and medicine.  She is an expert in developing machine learning approaches for biological data, network methods and most recently, data integration of omics and clinical data. The current focus of her lab is on developing methods that capture heterogeneity and identify disease mechanisms in complex human diseases. Her translational focus is on methods that efficiently combine many types of patient measurements to refine diagnosis, improve prognosis and personalise drug response prediction for patients with complex human diseases. She was recently awarded an Early Researcher Award from the Ministry of Research and Innovation and a Canada Research Chair in Computational Medicine.</p>

									           <p>Alex graduated with a Bachelor's degree in computer science from U of T, and is currently pursuing a Master's degree. Alex is interested in creating machine learning models that are able to fail gracefully. A fundamental part of this is analyzing what relationships a model is actually learning by testing it against pathological examples. He's also interested in non-conventional loss functions since he believes that current loss functions are used mainly for convenience and don't represent underlying concepts that a model should learn. He has experience working with several types of data including pharmacogenomics data (both drugs and cell lines), time series data (not health related), and imaging data. Alex enjoys cooking, creating workout programs, and the occasional game of Starcraft 2. </p>
